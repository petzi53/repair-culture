# Exploring repairData

Here I will look into `repairs`, the dataset from the [Open Repair Alliance](https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads/) I have published as [`repairData` package](https://github.com/petzi53/repairData). These explorations include `batteries`, `printers`, `mobiles`, `tablets`, four datasets collected and constructed during EU-sponsored online events.

This repo is a kind of testbed to see which information and changes are to be included and published as a new version of the `repairData` package. Why do I not post these changes immediately and directly on [my package website](https://petzi53.github.io/repairData/)? The reason is my slim experience with publishing packages. Maybe my wariness turns out to be superfluous and brings with it an unnecessary additional working load. But at the moment, I feel better and more secure to have a repo as a scratchpad for trying out ideas.
